# SpaceX-Project.
The goal of the project is to forecast whether the initial phase of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will complete a successful landing. Various data science techniques have been used to scrutinize launch data and enhance the accuracy of launch predictions. This is important as it enables SpaceX to reutilize the first stage of the rocket.
